          <br/><p class="text">When Russian President Vladimir Putin made a state visit to China on Thursday, just nine days after starting his fifth term in office, he met with Chinese President Xi Jinping to underline their robust bilateral ties and send a tough message to the US. In a joint statement, the two leaders said they oppose hegemonic attempts by the US to change the balance of power in Northeast Asia and military threats by the US and its allies against North Korea. </p><p class="text">“The parties oppose the acts of military intimidation by the US and its allies that escalate confrontation with North Korea, which may lead to armed incidents and a rise in tensions on the Korean Peninsula,” read a joint statement released following Xi’s summit with Putin at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Thursday morning, according to the Russian news agency TASS. </p><p class="text">The two countries’ latest broadside against the US goes one step further than their emphasis on the importance of dialogue to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue in a joint statement following a summit in Moscow in March 2023. </p><p class="text">In the latest statement, the two countries mentioned the negative impact on regional peace and stability of the US’ Indo-Pacific strategy, which they said is modeled on NATO’s destructive policy. They also expressed opposition to intervention by external forces on the question of stability in the South China Sea. Russia and China added that they would continue cooperation in the military domain. </p><p class="text">In regard to the war in Ukraine, China and Russia emphasized the need for a political solution. </p><p class="text">“China and Russia believe that the Ukraine crisis must be resolved by political means,” Xi said in a press conference following the summit. “China hopes that peace and stability will return to the European continent soon and is ready to constructively contribute to making this happen.” </p><p class="text">The two countries also stressed their economic solidarity. </p><p class="text">“We wholeheartedly embrace collaboration with our Chinese counterparts in the automobile manufacturing sector, where they have demonstrated clear and undeniable successes and competitive advantages through fair competition. We look forward to further developing this cooperation,” Putin said while praising China’s capacity for producing automobiles. </p><p class="text">Putin’s remarks appear to be aimed at the US, which has taken China to task for what it describes as its “overcapacity.” </p><p class="text">Putin and Xi also underscored the strength of their bilateral relationship for watchers in the international community. </p><p class="text">At the beginning of their summit, Xi said that China is always prepared to be a good neighbor, good friend and good companion of Russia through mutual trust. Putin responded by saying that bilateral cooperation isn’t opportunistic and doesn’t harm anyone. </p><p class="text">By Choi Hyun-june, Beijing correspondent </p><p class="text">Please direct questions or comments to [<a href="mailto:english@hani.co.kr">english@hani.co.kr</a>] </p></div><a id="inner_originArticle" href="https://www.hani.co.kr/arti/international/china/1140881.html" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.hani.co.kr/section-image/12/english/images/com/btn/btn_original.gif" alt="button that move to original korean article (클릭시 원문으로 이동하는 버튼)"/></a></div><div id="rt" class="related-article"><h3 class="article-tit">Related stories</h3><ul><li><a href="/arti/english_edition/e_international/1141008.html" class="ellipsis1">· <!-- -->Putin’s trip to China comes amid 63% increase in bilateral trade under US-led sanctions</a></li><li><a href="/arti/english_edition/e_editorial/1141006.html" class="ellipsis1">· <!-- -->[Editorial] Intensifying US-China rivalry means Seoul must address uncertainty with Beijing sooner than later</a></li><li><a href="/arti/english_edition/e_international/1141005.html" class="ellipsis1">· <!-- -->China, Russia put foot down on US moves in Asia, ratchet up solidarity with N.
